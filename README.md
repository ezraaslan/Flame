# Flame
In this isometric puzzle game, you play as the master of fire -- a lone soldier equipped only with 10 matches in a world where anything and everything can catch fire. Navigate through a maze of rooms and corridors as you manipulate heat and light to solve puzzles -- but don't let your match count get to zero!

INSTRUCTIONS:
Move around as you like and explore the areas in the game next to you. Press SPACE to light a match (of which you only have 10 -- if you light all of them you die) and light wood and other stuff on fire to open new pathways and interact with NPCs.
